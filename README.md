# dsh-mindppt

MindPPT is a Cordis-native experiment that treats presentation slides as nodes on an infinite mind-map canvas.

The project is intentionally **Cordis-entangled**: major capabilities are implemented as Cordis plugins and services rather than standalone domain libraries. DSH integration is optional, while Cordis is part of the runtime architecture.

## Core idea

```text
MindPPT source code
       |
       v
   code-parser
       |
       v
MindPPT structure
   |          |
   v          v
canvas      camera
   |
   v
Excalidraw
```

A slide is rendered as an Excalidraw frame. Tree edges define the primary spatial structure, soft links add cross-tree relations, and presentation paths define optional playback routes through that structure.

## Initial plugin split

- `code-editor` — edits MindPPT source; source code is the single source of truth.
- `code-parser` — parses MindPPT source into the renderable structure.
- `canvas-excalidraw` — subscribes to structure changes and renders a read-only Excalidraw canvas.
- `camera` — controls presentation navigation and viewport transitions.
- `dsh-capability` — exposes authoring knowledge, source access, templates, and agent-facing tools to DSH.
- `dsh-mindppt-sidebar` — mounts MindPPT into the DSH sidebar.

The standalone web host will run the same Cordis plugins without requiring DSH.
